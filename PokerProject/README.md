# whoops.. deleted the actual README file. Can obtain the file from github sample python project i think.

# Ideas for the program:

# Don't want to clutter the src doc so putting all my commented ideas here.


1. create a deck of cards using 'class'
2. Could test the dealt hands to make sure each combination of cards is dealt equally as deals -> infinity.
3. Could shuffle the 'cards_to_be_split' list more. - would it make a difference to 2.?
4. 



# Comments:
1. Dont need the first_run_done variable in the betting_round() function any more as the initial betting list is not [0,0,0]; it has  been updated with the SB & BB added to it.
